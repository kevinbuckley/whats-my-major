Students develop their skills by using analytical tools and data to answer both large- and small-scale questions about crime. There are several paths and concentrations for students to specialize in while learning foundational knowledge and ethics, including civic engagement in the community. These concentrations include: </p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Criminal Justice - The Criminal Justice concentration is designed as the most flexible, focusing its curriculum primarily on the substance of criminal justice institutions and crime without requiring many of the analytics- and computer-based courses the other two concentrations require. Criminal Justice is primarily intended for students seeking to double major, prepare for law school, take on multiple minors (e.g., a language and legal studies), or for students who desire a traditional criminal justice education.</li>\n    <li>Justice Informatics - This concentration brings together computing and informatics with criminology and criminal justice to produce globally aware and technology-proficient graduates who bring an analytical and information-led approach to solving societal issues. Students will learn how to collect, manage, visualize, and analyze large sources of information so that they can bring their expertise into the crime and justice occupational arena and/or graduate school.</li>\n    <li>Justice Studies - The Justice Studies concentration begins with the fundamental assertion that crime and crime policy are generally interconnected with social, economic, health, and environmental risk factors in ways that extend beyond the traditional criminal justice system. Thus, while the other Criminology and Justice Studies concentrations focus largely on crime, criminology, crime science, and analysis, Justice Studies more thoroughly considers issues of justice, fairness, and due process across a range of domains, groups, and places that are frequently - but not always -directly related to crime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: the part-time option is only offered in the online format.</p>\n<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=3E5D8648E50544F2B7DD3C8B02FA297E&amp;_z=z\" class=\"icon-link btn btn--primary\">\n<span class=\"icon-link__text\">Apply Now</span>\n</a>","contentUrl":null,"displayUrl":null,"image":null,"id":"{0EDB0F9F-DA82-48A2-989E-F343818BB342}","contentType":null,"college":"College of Arts and Sciences","program":"BS","infoBlocks":[{"body":"<h4>Location(s)</h4><ul><li>Philadelphia</li><li>Online</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--locations"},{"body":"<h4>Cooperative Education Options</h4><ul><li>One Co-op (Four years)</li><li>No Co-op (Four years)</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>Enrollment Options</h4><ul><li>Full-Time</li><li>Part-Time</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>More Information</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://catalog.drexel.edu/undergraduate/collegeofartsandsciences/criminologyandjusticestudies/\">Catalog Description</a></li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>Contact Us</h4><p><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=F5C0F2D756C046CDB0A5FDB6831586F9&amp;_z=z\">Request More Information</a><br>\n<a href=\"tel:8002373935\">1.800.2.DREXEL</a><br>\n<a href=\"tel:12158956700\">1.215.895.2400</a><br>\n<a href=\"mailto:enroll@drexel.edu\">enroll@drexel.edu</a></p>\n<br class=\"t-last-br\">","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"}]},{"date":null,"authors":[],"title":"Culinary Arts","body":"<p>The minor in Culinary Arts is designed for students pursuing a variety of majors who also have an interest in food and cuisine.

They also become proficient in numerical techniques, parallel processing, electronic communication, and the basic software and computer languages relevant to physics research &mdash; all of which helps prepare graduates to enter their careers with a distinct advantage. </p>\n<p>Transfer students may only enroll for the fall or winter term.</p>\n<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=3E5D8648E50544F2B7DD3C8B02FA297E&amp;_z=z\" class=\"icon-link btn btn--primary\">\n<span class=\"icon-link__text\">Apply Now</span>\n</a>","contentUrl":null,"displayUrl":null,"image":null,"id":"{CD8F8EC6-DBA7-4E50-8F2C-E463CC37AD48}","contentType":null,"college":"College of Arts and Sciences","program":"Minor, BS","infoBlocks":[{"body":"<h4>Location(s)</h4><ul><li>Philadelphia</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--locations"},{"body":"<h4>Cooperative Education Options</h4><ul><li>Three Co-op (Five years)</li><li>One Co-op (Four years)</li><li>No Co-op (Four years)</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>Enrollment Options</h4><ul><li>Full-Time</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>More Information</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://catalog.drexel.edu/undergraduate/collegeofartsandsciences/physics/\">Catalog Description</a></li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>Contact Us</h4><p><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=F5C0F2D756C046CDB0A5FDB6831586F9&amp;_z=z\">Request More Information</a><br>\n<a href=\"tel:8002373935\">1.800.2.DREXEL</a><br>\n<a href=\"tel:12158956700\">1.215.895.2400</a><br>\n<a href=\"mailto:enroll@drexel.edu\">enroll@drexel.edu</a></p>\n<br class=\"t-last-br\">","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"}]},{"date":null,"authors":[],"title":"Playwriting","body":"<p>The minor in Playwriting is intended to guide students from the acquisition of foundational playwriting skills through the completion of a full-length stage play.

Being undeclared can signify various stages, ranging from contemplating an area of study to selecting a specific major and career path within the broader program.</p>\n<p>For students with a broad interest in computing and information science, selecting the undeclared option is recommended. Drexel offers first-year courses specifically related to technical aspects of the field, which will count towards their degree even if they decide to major in a non-technical area. Drexel&rsquo;s emphasis on career preparation will also help provide a foundational education for undeclared students. Upon choosing a major, students will select a co-op track (such as the three co-op option to be completed in five years, or the one co-op option to be completed in four years)</p>\n<p>This option is not available to transfer students.</p>\n<a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=3E5D8648E50544F2B7DD3C8B02FA297E&amp;_z=z\" class=\"icon-link btn btn--primary\">\n<span class=\"icon-link__text\">Apply Now</span>\n</a>","contentUrl":null,"displayUrl":null,"image":null,"id":"{DE1DDE2C-1572-40BA-BACB-DBCF528FCA52}","contentType":null,"college":"College of Computing and Informatics","program":"Undeclared","infoBlocks":[{"body":"<h4>Location(s)</h4><ul><li>Philadelphia</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50 program-item__info-block--locations"},{"body":"<h4>Enrollment Options</h4><ul><li>Full-Time</li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>More Information</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://catalog.drexel.edu/undergraduate/collegeofcomputingandinformatics/computing-infosci-undeclared/index.html\">Catalog Description</a></li></ul>","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"},{"body":"<h4>Contact Us</h4><p><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=F5C0F2D756C046CDB0A5FDB6831586F9&amp;_z=z\">Request More Information</a><br>\n<a href=\"tel:8002373935\">1.800.2.DREXEL</a><br>\n<a href=\"tel:12158956700\">1.215.895.2400</a><br>\n<a href=\"mailto:enroll@drexel.edu\">enroll@drexel.edu</a></p>\n<br class=\"t-last-br\">","class":"program-item__info-block program-item__info-block--50"}]},{"date":null,"authors":[],"title":"Undeclared - Design & Media","body":"<p>The Undeclared Design &amp; Media option allows incoming high school students to explore the wide range of academic programs at the Antoinette Westphal College.
